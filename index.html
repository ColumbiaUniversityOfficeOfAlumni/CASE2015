			<h2>Illuminate: Celebrating the Columbia Campaign and Our Future</h2>
			<p>December 31, 2013 marked the conclusion of the historic $6.1 billion Columbia Campaign. To celebrate this record-breaking ten-year effort, the alumni and development marketing and communications team launched a comprehensive, multi-phase end of Campaign communications strategy: Illuminate. Echoing Columbia’s motto, <em>In lumine Tuo videbimus lumen</em> ("In Thy light we see light"), Illuminate aimed to appropriately thank over 205,000 donors and volunteers, celebrate our collective success, and pivot toward Columbia’s future.</p>
			<p>The effort was inclusive across all levels and affiliations &mdash; from in person (a high-end stewardship dinner held at New York's historic Morgan Library) to online (a social media-driven day of thanks for the entire Columbia community). To highlight the human dimension and the impact of giving, we created an end of Campaign website &mdash; the <a href="http://illuminate.columbia.edu/">Illuminate site</a> &mdash; that featured <a href="http://illuminate.columbia.edu/stories">33 donor impact stories</a>, an interactive <a href="http://illuminate.columbia.edu/explore/">Campaign data visualization</a>, over <a href="http://illuminate.columbia.edu/future-priorities">50 future priorities</a> from Columbia’s schools and programs, and videos featuring a <a href="http://vimeo.com/90343996">thank you from President Bollinger</a>, an introduction to our <a href="http://vimeo.com/91512733">new campus in Manhattanville</a>, and <a href="http://vimeo.com/88758512">Campaign highlights</a>.</p>

			<h2>Objectives</h2>
			<p>Illuminate sought to celebrate the Campaign's success, highlight the University's momentum, and show the direction we are now more poised than ever to head. In addition, we wanted to give alumni and donors the opportunity to engage with and share a variety of content about Columbia and the Campaign. The goal was not merely to communicate what the Campaign did, but what an institution like Columbia can do and what donors giving through Columbia helped support.</p>

					<p>The <a href="http://illuminate.columbia.edu/">Illuminate site</a> was created to provide a Campaign readout, show messages of gratitude and impact, and give a preview of where Columbia is headed. It is a responsive-designed website, with fluid navigation that allows easy access to a variety of multimedia content related to the end of The Columbia Campaign. It features an interactive <a href="http://illuminate.columbia.edu/explore/">data visualization</a>, Campaign highlights, <a href="http://illuminate.columbia.edu/stories">33 donor impact stories</a>, a <a href="http://illuminate.columbia.edu/campaign-highlights#donor-roll">donor roll</a>, videos, messages from prominent Columbia alumni, infographics, and over <a href="http://illuminate.columbia.edu/future-priorities">50 future priorities</a> from Columbia’s schools and programs.</p>

					<h3>Data Visualization</h3>

					<p>In partnership with Periscopic, a Portland-based data visualization firm, we created an online <a href="http://illuminate.columbia.edu/explore/">data visualization</a> to help donors and alumni explore the impact of the historic Columbia Campaign. It took on the challenge of translating ten years and $6.1 billion into an interactive experience that is fueled by the user’s interests and curiosity. It goes a step beyond the numbers – allowing users to explore by theme or school/program – to show stories of impact and provide a snapshot of the future the Campaign has helped make possible.</p>
